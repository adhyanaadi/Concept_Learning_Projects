# Currency Converter 💱

A simple currency converter built using React that helped me deepen my understanding of handling multiple state variables, creating custom hooks, and effectively using `useEffect` with dependencies. Additionally, this project reinforced my knowledge of JavaScript's `map` method for iterating over arrays.

## 🚀 Features
- Convert between different currencies in real-time
- Manage and update multiple state variables efficiently
- Use custom hooks for better code reusability
- Handle `useEffect` dependencies correctly
- Implement `map` for rendering currency options dynamically

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React (Vite)
- useState & useEffect hooks
- Custom Hooks
- Fetch API for currency rates
- CSS (for basic styling)

## 📌 What I Learned
- Managing multiple state variables in a single React project
- Using `useEffect` correctly with dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Creating and utilizing custom hooks for cleaner and more reusable code
- Revising JavaScript’s `map` function to dynamically render lists
