# 🔐 Random Password Generator

A simple **Random Password Generator** built with React that generates a secure password using alphabets, numericals, and special characters.  
Through this project, I learned and implemented **React Hooks** like:  
- `useState`  
- `useEffect`  
- `useCallback`  
- `useRef`
